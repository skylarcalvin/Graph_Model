# This will test the graph model defined by the networkGraph class.

# First import the networkGraph class into this script from the graphGen script.
from graphGen import networkGraph
from random import randint

# Main program execution...
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Initialize a class instance with seven nodes.
    g = networkGraph(7)

    # Create various hops between notes, creating a wighted network.
    g.addHop(0, 1, 50)
    g.addHop(1, 2, 35)
    g.addHop(1, 3, 42)
    g.addHop(2, 3, 53)
    g.addHop(3, 5, 40)
    g.addHop(2, 4, 24)
    g.addHop(4, 5, 35)
    g.addHop(3, 4, 15)
    g.addHop(2, 6, 23)
    g.addHop(4, 6, 15)

    #### At this point we have a working network structure.     ####
    ####    We can now find all possible routes in the network. ####

    #   between the two, saving then to the routes class attribute. Then, we'll find the
    # longest routes in the network, and print them out.
